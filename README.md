Long waiting times is an important issue for health services in Canada, and the main concern is about waiting times for elective treatments [[1]("https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/waiting-times-for-health-services_242e3c8c-en")],. Among the OECD countries, Canadaâ€™s waiting times problem ranks in the medium-high priority level, while Germany, Korea, Japan, Switzerland, and U.S rank in low priority level [[2]("https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/242e3c8c-en/1/3/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/242e3c8c-en&_csp_=e90031be7ce6b03025f09a0c506286b0&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#chapter-d1e287")]. After the COVID-19 outbreak, tens of thousands of scheduled surgeries being cancelled or postponed across Canada, which prolonged the surgical wait times. In B.C. province, between Mar. 16 and May 18, 2020, it was estimated that 30298 elective nonurgent surgeries were either postponed or not scheduled because of the COVID-19 pandemic [[3]("https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/conducting-health-research/surgical-renewal-plan.pdf")]. If we could have a public dashboard of surgical data like that of COVID-19 for the province, it will help both the patients to know the situation and the doctors as well as the health authorities to look at where improvements are most needed [[4]("https://bc.ctvnews.ca/b-c-doctors-criticize-top-down-approach-and-government-secrecy-as-minister-defends-surgical-strategy-1.5767547")]. Our app will show how many waiting and completed cases in B.C. and allow users to check the trend of completed cases proportion and the waiting times for different procedures in by filtering different health authorities, hospitals, and procedures.

## About this Dashboard

The app opens a dashboard that shows the information about surgical waiting times in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Users can select health authorities of BC from the buttons (eg, Northern, Interior, Vancouver Island, Vancouver Coastal etc.) and years from the slider which will update the 4 charts (proportion of completed cases, BC health authority map, Fastest/Slowest treated procedures, total waiting and completed cases of a hospital ) and information cards accordingly. The proportion of completed cases chart shows quarterly distribution of completed cases of all health authorities based on the selected years. The BC health authority map highlights the selected health authority. The fastest/slowest treated procedures chart has the option to select between fastest and slowest radio buttons. The total waiting and completed cases of a hospital has a dropdown menu of different hospitals based on the selected health authority.
